To assess the coordination between the proteins that were found to be strongly positively correlated with growth rate we therefore calculated the slope of a linear regression line for the normalized concentration vs. the growth rate for every one of these proteins.
The results are presented in Figure \ref{fig:globalfit} (Further details on the calculation are in section \ref{concacrossconds}).
Further more, for every slope obtained for any protein, we calculated the $95\%$ confidence interval of that slope.
We find that the distribution of estimated slopes can result from having a common, single response slope, given the experimental noise in the measurements (For further discussion see SI)\emph{ToDo: The red line in the figure, representing the expected distribution given the average slope and noise does not fit the results very well, more thought is needed to settle this}.
This analysis thus reveals that, not only is a significant fraction of the proteome strongly positively correlated with the growth rate, but that, as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:globalfit}, this response is coordinated.
