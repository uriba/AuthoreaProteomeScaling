Theoretically, the fastest doubling time a cell may have is the doubling time achieved when all of the proteome of the cell is the bio-synthetic machinery.
We denote this minimal doubling time by $T_B$.
If the bio-synthetic machinery is only half of the proteome, the doubling time will be $2T_B$ etc.
