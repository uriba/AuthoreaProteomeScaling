This relationship can be simply formulated as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:concentration-ratio}
  p_i(c)=\frac{P_i(c)}{P(c)}=\frac{w_i(c)}{\sum_jw_j(c)}
\end{equation}
where $p_i(c)$ denotes the fraction of protein $i$ under condition $c$ out of the proteome, $P_i(c)$ denotes the mass of protein $i$ under condition $c$ per cell, $P(c)$ denotes the total mass of proteins per cell under condition $c$, and the sum, $\sum_jw_j(c)$, is taken over all the genes the cell has.
