The model assumes that, under favorable growth conditions, the cell actively down-regulates some proteins that are needed in harsher conditions, as is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:model}.
As a result, the fraction of each of the rest of the proteins out of the proteome increases, showing the same relative ratios, as long as there is no specific regulation.
The growth rate thus increases, as the ratio of bio-synthetic machinery to the rest of the proteome increases, as is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:model}B.
To demonstrate the idea concretely, one could think about the down regulation of the lac operon in the presence of Glucose, that alleviates the need to transcribe and translate lactose metabolism genes and coincides with faster growth.
