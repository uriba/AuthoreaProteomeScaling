To illustrate this assumption concretely, one could think about the total amount of proteins per cell (measured in amino-acids count) divided by the number of ribosomes in the cell.
Assuming each ribosome translates at an approximately condition-independent rate of about 20 amino-acids per second, and as the amount of actively translating ribosomes is also relatively condition-independent \cite{Philips2009} (\emph{ToDo:and its refs}), it follows that the doubling time is linearly dependent on the ratio of proteins to ribosomes in the biomass as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:model}B.
