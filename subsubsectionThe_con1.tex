\subsubsection{The concentration of a non-differentially regulated protein is expected to increase with the growth rate} 
Recalling that the connection between the growth rate and the doubling time is: $g(c)=\frac{\ln(2)}{\tau(c)}$, we now combine Equation \ref{eq:concentration-ratio} with Equation \ref{eq:gr-ratio} to get that:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:default-response}
  p_i(c)=\frac{w_i(c)}{\sum_jw_j(c)}=\frac{w_i(c)}{W_B}\frac{W_B}{\sum_jw_j(c)}=\frac{w_i(c)}{W_B}\frac{T_B}{\ln(2)}g(c)
\end{equation}
