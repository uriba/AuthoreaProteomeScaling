The [ref Heinemann] data set contains proteomic data measurements under 19 different environmental conditions.
However, some of these conditions are expected to affect the proteome composition in ways not related to the actual growth rate.
Specifically, our model assumes that bio-synthesis rates are condition independent and, at most, change only with growth rate.
That will likely not be the case under specific kinds of conditions such as osmotic pressure, low pH and heat stress.
Additionally, our model assumes exponential growth, implying that measurements taken at stationary phase are expected to differ from simple extrapolation of the model to zero growth rate.
We have therefore omitted such conditions from our analysis and analyzed only those conditions under which our assumptions for bio-synthesis rates being either constant or have a simple relation to the growth rate do hold \emph{ToDo: add these analyses to the SI}.
