\subsubsection{Slower biological processes rates at slower growth affect the relation between proteome composition and growth rate}
The simplistic model assumes that the doubling time is proportional to the ratio of total protein to bio-synthetic protein.
This assumption fails if the rate at which the bio-synthetic machinery operates changes across conditions.
Replacing this assumption by a dependence of bio-synthesis rate with growth rate (such that, the faster the growth, the faster the synthesis rates), will affect the resulting predictions as well.
