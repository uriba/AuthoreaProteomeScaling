According to the model, every gene, under every environmental condition, is given an 'affinity-for-expression' (or 'intrinsic-strength') score that encapsulates its gene-specific control state under the condition considered.
We denote the affinity of gene $i$ under growth condition $c$ by $w_i(c)$ (the notion of affinity for expression is not new, and was first suggested in  \cite{Maaloe1969}).
Our model assumes that the bio-synthetic resources of the cell (Ribosomes, RNA Polymerases, etc.) are distributed among the genes according to their affinities under the condition at hand.
The notion of affinities can thus reduce the number of parameters needed to predict expression levels markedly.
Instead of an expression level for every gene under each condition, there is only a need for the characterization of the affinities a gene may obtain under relevant environmental cues, a parameter set that is expected to be much smaller and easily characterized.
