To summarize, the simplistic model we have constructed predicts that, under no specific regulation, the fraction a protein occupies out of the proteome should scale with the growth rate.
A group of such proteins should therefore maintain their relative concentrations across conditions.
Finally, when the growth rate approaches zero, the fractions of such proteins, and thus their concentrations, should also approach zero.
