Despite these advancements, many gaps remain in our understanding of the connection between gene expression and growth rate.
Primarily, it is unclear what is the degree of interconnection between gene expression and growth rate.
Is it unique to specific groups of genes or is it a more global phenomenon shared across most genes in the genome?
Genome-wide proteomic data sets, such as those generated by mass-spectrometry, which probe the proteome composition at different growth rates, offer potential insights into these questions.
