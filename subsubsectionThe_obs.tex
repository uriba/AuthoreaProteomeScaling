\subsubsection{The observed growth rate is an outcome of proteome composition and environmental conditions}
While it is sometimes implied that different cellular components are regulated by the growth rate, here we consider the growth rate as an outcome of the environmental conditions that affect the proteome composition.
Specifically, we arrive at the doubling time as the result of dividing the total amount of proteins per cell by the amount of bio-synthesis machinery in that cell.
The larger the ratio of total proteins to bio-synthesis proteins is, the longer these bio-synthesis proteins will have to operate in order to duplicate the proteome, and thus the longer the doubling time of the cell will be.
