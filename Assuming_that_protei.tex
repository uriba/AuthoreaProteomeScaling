Assuming that protein degradation acts on all proteins in the same way, and that it is invariant in the growth condition, the effect of protein degradation can be understood as follows: at any time, some fraction of the entire proteome is degraded.
Therefore, the \emph{observed} growth rate, $g$, is, in fact, the amount of proteins produced \emph{minus} the amount of proteins degraded.
To illustrate, if the measured growth rate is zero, the implication is not that no proteins are produced, but rather that proteins are produced at exactly the same rate as they are degraded.
