Furthermore, we examined how the response of the strongly correlated proteins relates to the well-studied response of ribosomes concentration.
To that end, we performed the same analysis of slopes, restricting it to ribosomal proteins alone, as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:globalfit} (green bars).
We find that, on average, strongly correlated proteins scale in the same way as ribosomal proteins do, implying that the observed response of ribosomal proteins to growth rate is coordinated with a much larger fraction of the proteome, encompassing many more cellular components.
