There are different, alternative ways to assess the resources consumed by a specific protein out of the resources available in the cell.
On top of the measures detailed above, one could consider either the total mass or molecule count of a specific protein out of the biomass, or out of the dry weight of the cell, both of which take into account the ratio of total protein to biomass or dry weight which was neglected in our analysis.
Moreover, one can consider specific protein mass or molecule count per cell, thus reflecting changes in cell size across conditions.
Our analysis focused on the relations between different proteins and resource distribution inside the proteome, and thus avoided such metrics.
