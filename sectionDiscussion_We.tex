\section{Discussion}
We characterized a significant, coordinated response in \emph{E.coli} between many proteins and the growth rate.
This response spans proteins from various functional groups and is not related to the specific medium of growth.
A similar phenomena is observed for \emph{S.cerevisiae} as was reported in \cite{Keren2013a} and may thus be conserved across various organisms and domains of life.
Our analysis suggests that, while changes in the proteome composition may seem complex, they can, to a large extent, be attributed to the linear increase with growth rate of a large number of proteins, at the expense of a few, down-regulated proteins \emph{ToDo: quantify by variation explained}.
The well studied scaling of ribosomes concentration with growth rate can be considered one manifestation of the more general phenomena we describe here.
We find that this response, when considering ribosomal proteins fraction out of the proteome, is not unique and is, in fact, shared with many other proteins spanning different functional groups.
