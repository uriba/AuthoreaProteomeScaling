In this work we analyzed two recently published proteomic data sets of \emph{E.coli} under different growth conditions \cite{Valgepea2013} [ref unpublished Heinemann].
We find a statistically significant positive correlation between growth rate and the protein concentration of many genes, from diverse functional groups.
We present a parsimonious model, which does not require fine-tuning according to organism and condition-specific parameters, that quantitatively predicts the relationship between gene regulation, protein abundance and growth rate.
Our model provides a baseline for the behavior of endogenous genes in conditions in which they are not differentially regulated, on top of which different regulatory aspects can be added.
It suggests that positive correlation of protein concentration with growth rate is a system-emerging property that is the result of passive redistribution of resources, without need for specific regulation mechanisms.
