Many studies monitored the ribosome concentration in cells and its interdependence with growth rate \cite{Scott2010, Bremer1987, Schaechter1958, 1974, Zaslaver2009, eco-sal}.
While in all of these studies a linear dependence of ribosome concentration with growth rate was observed, in some cases different response strengths were found, compared with the observations in this study.
A discussion for various reasons that may underlie these differences is in \ref{ribosomeconc}.
