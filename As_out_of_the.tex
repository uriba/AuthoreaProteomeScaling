As, out of the conditions measured in the Heinemann data set, growth in LB media presented a much faster growth rate than the rest of the conditions measured, it dominated the behavior and trends calculated, when included in the analysis.
While including the data on growth in LB does not qualitatively changes the observed results, such analysis is less statistically robust.
We have therefore omitted LB growth data in the main analysis yet present it in the SI.
Including LB growth results in a much smaller set of proteins with a strong positive correlation with growth (as many of the proteins in that group in the slower conditions get down-regulated in LB, significantly reducing their Pearson correlation with growth rate).
On the other hand, the proteins that remain strongly positively correlated with growth rate when LB is included in the analysis show a higher correlation compared with the strongly correlated with growth rate proteins under the slower conditions.
Furthermore, despite the decrease in the number of proteins that are strongly positively correlated with growth when LB is included in the analysis, these proteins form up to $50\%$ of the proteome under LB.
