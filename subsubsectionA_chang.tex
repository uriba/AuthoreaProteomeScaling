\subsubsection{A change in growth condition triggers changes in expression of specific proteins that indirectly affect all of the proteome}
Different environmental conditions may require the expression of different genes in order to achieve growth.
For example, comparing two growth media, one that includes amino-acids, and one that does not, it can be assumed that when amino-acids are present, no need exists for the cell to express amino-acids synthesizing enzymes, whereas when amino-acids are absent, these enzymes must be expressed.
Therefore, ideally, the cell will be able to sense the presence or absence of amino-acids in the growth media and, for the amino-acids synthesizing genes, down or up regulate their affinities accordingly.
If we now consider some arbitrary gene $i$, whose specific affinity is unaltered between these two conditions, we suggest that, other things being equal, its concentration will still change between the two conditions as the affinities of at least some of the other genes (the amino-acids synthesizing enzymes) change, changing the denominator in equation \ref{eq:concentration-ratio} and thus affecting the distribution of resources between all of the expressed genes.
