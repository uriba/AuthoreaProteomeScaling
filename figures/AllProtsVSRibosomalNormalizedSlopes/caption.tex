    A histogram of the slopes of regression lines for every high correlation protein, for the two data sets analyzed.
    Ribosomal proteins are colored in green and non ribosomal proteins in blue.
    To eliminate differences in slopes resulting from different proteins having different average concentrations across conditions, the concentrations for every protein were divided by the average concentration of that protein prior to calculating the linear regression slope (see text for further details).
    The expected distribution of slopes given the experimental noise, assuming all proteins are coordinated, is plotted in red.
    Left panel - data from \cite{Valgepea2013}, right panel - data from \cite{Heinemann2014}.
    High correlation proteins share similar normalized slopes, implying they are coordinated, maintaining their relative ratios across conditions (see text/methods for further details).
    Ribosomal proteins scale with growth rate in a manner similar to the rest of the high correlation proteins.
