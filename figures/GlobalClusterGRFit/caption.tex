The sum of the concentrations of the strongly correlated proteins (defined as having a correlation above 0.8 for the V data set and a correlation above 0.4 for the H data set) in each of the data sets, with linear regression lines, is shown.
These proteins form a large fraction ($>50\%$) out of the proteome at higher growth rates.
The change in the concentration of the strongly correlated proteins follows trend lines with slopes of $\approx 0.5$ meaning their total concentration doubles itself as the growth rate changes by about 5-fold.
\emph{ToDo: Comment on the estimated degradation rates (horizontal intercepts, -0.44 for H and -0.34 for V) and rate changes as noted in the model. confidence intervals?}
