\subsubsection{Protein degradation differentiates between measured growth rate and biomass synthesis rate}
Accounting for protein degradation affects the expected concentration of non-differentially regulated proteins at zero growth rate.
Thus, accounting for protein degradation may serve as a partial explanation for the discrepancy between experimental data and predictions made by the model.
