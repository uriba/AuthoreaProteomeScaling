The lower correlation and higher variability found in the H data set partially results from the variability in the conditions it contains as well as the higher number of conditions measured across a similar rage of growth rates.
Specifically, as this data set includes measurements under different carbon sources, as opposed to the V data set that uses the same carbon source on all measurements, a larger variability in expression patterns is expected.
Restricting the analysis of the H data set only to chemostat conditions supports this suggestion and shows much less variability as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:growthcorrchemo}.
