\subsection{Theoretical model}
What is the simplest way to explain the observed coordinated growth rate dependence, that is, can this behavior be explained without invoking parameter tuning or complex layers of regulation?
In an attempt to parsimoniously explain this wide-spread, coordinated, positive response, we have constructed a minimalistic model that is able to reproduce these observations as the outcome of redistribution of resources of the bio-synthesis machinery.
Before presenting the model mathematically, we give a brief intuitive depiction.
