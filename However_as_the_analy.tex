However, as the analysis of experimental data in Figure \ref{fig:globalgrcorr} shows, while the concentration of many proteins does indeed scale linearly with growth rate, this scaling does not imply a drop to zero concentration at zero growth.
There are at least two factors that have been neglected in the model, but that can account for this result, and the analysis of their expected effects follows.
