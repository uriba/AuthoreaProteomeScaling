To conclude, we observe that a large fraction of the change in the proteome composition across conditions is the result of scaling with growth rate of many proteins \emph{ToDo:make concrete by calculating}.
This scaling with growth rate is coordinated, meaning the proteins maintain their relative abundances.
Finally, this fraction of proteins encompasses many proteins from different functional groups and cellular mechanisms.
