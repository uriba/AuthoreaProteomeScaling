\subsection{Relation to other studies}
The findings in this study support and broaden the findings in other recent studies.
Specifically, for \emph{S.cerevisiae} a few recent studies found that the concentration of the majority of the proteins is coordinated across conditions \cite{Keren2013a, Gasch2000, Brauer2008a} and increases with growth rate.\emph{ToDo:verify this for these references and add numbers} 
In principle, the model we suggest here can be applied to any microorganism and may thus also serve as a potential explanation to the phenomena observed in these studies.
